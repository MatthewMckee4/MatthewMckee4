# About Me

I am currently in my 4th year at Glasgow University studying Computing Science and Mathematics.

I am a Software Engineer at Sivers Photonics, working on in-house software.

In my free time, I enjoy writing Rust and Python.

Some of the projects I have been working on are:

- Karva, a Python test framework, written in Rust.
- Seal, an extremely fast release management tool, written in Rust.
- ty, a Python type checker, written in Rust.
- GDSR, a tool for intuitive manipulation of GDSII files.
