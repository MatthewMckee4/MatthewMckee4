# About Me

I am currently in my 3rd year at Glasgow University studying Computing Science and Mathematics.

I am a Software Engineer at Sivers Photonics, working on an in-house software.
I am also a Software Engineer at GDSFactory, working on open and closed source software.
I am also a Software Engineer at the University of Glasgow for GUSS, currently not working on a project.

In my free time, I enjoy working on Python packages, including:

- Karva, a Python test framework, written in Rust.
- ty, a Python type checker, written in Rust.
- GDSR, a tool for intuitive manipulation of GDSII files.
