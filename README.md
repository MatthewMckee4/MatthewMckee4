# About Me:
I am currently in my 3rd year at Glasgow University studying Computing Science and Mathematics. 

I am a Software Engineer at Sivers Photonics, working on an in-house software.
I am also a Software Engineer at GDSFactory, working on open and closed source software.
I am also a Software Engineer at the University of Glasgow for GUSS, currently not working on a project.

In my free time, I enjoy working on Python packages, including GDSR, a tool for intuitive manipulation of GDSII files.
